-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,medical_condition,treatment,medication,symptom,anatomy,pathogen]
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation of why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score between 1 to 10, indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>

-Examples-
##
("entity"<|>MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION<|>medical_condition<|>A heart attack caused by blockage of blood flow to the heart muscle, requiring immediate emergency treatment)
##
("entity"<|>ASPIRIN<|>medication<|>An antiplatelet medication commonly used in emergency treatment of heart attacks to prevent blood clotting)
##
("entity"<|>CHEST PAIN<|>symptom<|>A common presenting symptom in emergency medicine that can indicate various cardiac, pulmonary, or other conditions)
##
("entity"<|>EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT<|>organization<|>Hospital unit specialized in providing immediate medical care for urgent and life-threatening conditions)
##
("relationship"<|>MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION<|>CHEST PAIN<|>Chest pain is a primary symptom of myocardial infarction<|>9)
##
("relationship"<|>ASPIRIN<|>MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION<|>Aspirin is a first-line treatment for myocardial infarction<|>8)
##
<|COMPLETE|>
