-Goal-
You are a medical research analyst. Your goal is to extract claims that relate to medical conditions, treatments, symptoms, diagnostic procedures, outcomes, and emergency medicine protocols from medical literature.

-Steps-
1. Analyze the provided text for claims about:
   - Disease mechanisms and pathophysiology
   - Treatment efficacy and outcomes
   - Diagnostic accuracy and procedures
   - Risk factors and epidemiology
   - Clinical protocols and guidelines
   - Patient outcomes and prognosis
   - Drug interactions and contraindications
   - Emergency procedures and interventions

2. For each claim, extract:
   - Subject: The medical entity or concept the claim is about
   - Object: What is being claimed about the subject
   - Type: The type of claim (treatment_outcome, diagnostic_finding, risk_factor, clinical_protocol, etc.)
   - Status: Whether the claim is established fact, hypothesis, or under investigation
   - Description: A detailed description of the claim

3. Format each claim as ("claim"<|><subject><|><object><|><type><|><status><|><description>)

4. Only extract claims that are:
   - Directly supported by the text
   - Medically or scientifically relevant
   - Specific enough to be verifiable

-Examples-
("claim"<|>SEPSIS<|>EARLY ANTIBIOTIC ADMINISTRATION<|>treatment_outcome<|>established<|>Early antibiotic administration within 1 hour of sepsis diagnosis significantly reduces mortality rates in emergency department patients)
("claim"<|>CHEST PAIN<|>TROPONIN ELEVATION<|>diagnostic_finding<|>established<|>Elevated troponin levels in patients with chest pain are highly specific for myocardial injury and acute coronary syndrome)

-Real Data-
Text: {input_text}
