## üß™ Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 for Python code formatting
- Use meaningful variable names, especially for medical terminology
- Add docstrings for all functions, especially clinical processing functions
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Medical Domain Considerations

- **Clinical Accuracy**: Ensure medical information is accurate and evidence-based
- **Terminology**: Use proper medical terminology and abbreviations
- **Safety**: Be cautious with medical recommendations and include appropriate disclaimers
- **Privacy**: Ensure no patient data or PHI is included in code or documentation

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Test with various medical query types
- Validate clinical accuracy with medical professionals when possible
- Ensure backward compatibility

## üìù Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** - Include relevant documentation updates
2. **Add tests** - Write tests for new functionality
3. **Clinical review** - For medical features, indicate clinical review status
4. **Commit message format**:
   ```
   feat: add clinical entity linking for medications
   
   - Integrate UMLS medication concepts
   - Add dosage extraction capabilities
   - Include interaction checking framework
   
   Clinical-Review: Pending
   ```

5. **Submit PR** with clear description of changes and clinical implications

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use conventional commit format:
- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `clinical:` - Clinical accuracy improvements
- `perf:` - Performance improvements
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests

## üè• Clinical Contribution Guidelines

### Medical Literature Integration

When adding new medical literature or abstracts:
- Ensure proper citation and attribution
- Verify content accuracy with reputable medical sources
- Include metadata (publication date, journal, etc.)
- Remove any patient identifiers

### Clinical Model Improvements

For enhancements to clinical models:
- Document model performance metrics
- Include validation against medical benchmarks
- Provide clinical context for improvements
- Consider specialty-specific adaptations

### Emergency Medicine Focus

Maintain focus on emergency medicine:
- Prioritize acute care scenarios
- Include time-sensitive clinical decisions
- Consider ED workflow integration
- Validate with emergency medicine practitioners

## üîç Areas for Contribution

   - Optimize GraphRAG processing
   - Enhance vector search efficiency

3. **Medical Specialization**
   - Add specialty-specific prompts
   - Integrate additional clinical models
   - Expand medical entity recognition

### Medium Priority

1. **User Experience**
   - Improve interface design
   - Add clinical workflow features
   - Enhance result visualization

2. **Integration**
   - EMR/EHR system compatibility
   - Clinical decision support integration
   - Mobile interface development

### Documentation Needs

1. **Clinical Use Cases** - More detailed medical scenarios
2. **API Documentation** - Comprehensive API guides
3. **Deployment Guides** - Production deployment instructions
4. **Clinical Evaluation** - Methods for validating clinical accuracy
